# monopoly

Simulates dice rolls and outputs a histogram of frequency of landing on properties.

Complete in that it considers:
* 3 doubles puts you in jail
* go to jail square puts you in jail
* chance and community chest cards that send you to jail, a particular square, or back 3 spaces

But not
* "pay a $100K fine or take a chance" card
